When any item in the list is clicked, I retrieve the relevant meal from the database using its ID and display it on the screen.

Here, the user can delete the relevant data from the database if he/she wishes.

When the user wants to add a new dish, he/she presses the plus button on the main page and the screen for adding a new dish appears.

When the user clicks the save button, the data is saved to the database.

?In this application, I learned how to create a database, retrieve data from the database, delete it, and list it.

?I learned how to ask for permission to go to the user's gallery and how to use the image from the gallery.

?I also learned how to customize designs.(font, views)
